Less than 10 years after their inception, cryptocurrencies[1] have emerged from obscurity to attract intense interest on the part of businesses and consumers, as well as central banks and other authorities. They garner attention because they promise to replace trust in long-standing institutions, such as commercial and central banks, with trust in a new, fully decentralised system founded on the blockchain and related distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

从诞生到如今这不到10年的时间里，加密货币[1]从一片混沌中脱颖而出，吸引了来自部分企业，消费者，甚至于中央银行以及其他政府当局的强烈兴趣。加密货币作为一种技术，希望用一种基于新的，完全分布式的由区块链以及分布式账本技术（DLT）建立的信用体系，来代替原本由商业和中央银行等常驻金融机构所代表的信用体系，这一打破传统的尝试引起了各行各业的注意。

This chapter evaluates whether cryptocurrencies could play any role as money: looking beyond the hype, what specific economic problems, if any, can current cryptocurrencies solve? The chapter first reviews the historical context. Many episodes of monetary instability and failed currencies illustrate that the institutional arrangements through which money is supplied matter a great deal. This review shows that the essence of good money has always been trust in the stability of its value. And for money to live up to its signature property – to act as a coordination device facilitating transactions – it needs to efficiently scale with the economy and be provided elastically to address fluctuating demand. These considerations call for specific institutional arrangements – hence the emergence of today’s independent and accountable central banks.

本章将评估加密货币是否可以扮演传统经济中的金钱角色：除了炒作之外，目前的加密货币能解决哪些具体的经济问题（如果有的话）？本章首先将回顾历史背景。过去发生的许多造成货币不稳定和信用货币危机的事件表明，货币供应的制度安排非常重要。回顾这些事件，优质货币的本质是对其价值稳定性形成一贯的信任。另外，为了实现货币背后的价值背书 ，作为促进交易的社会流通媒介，货币需要在政策上有效地与经济环境进行协调并提供弹性来应对波动的需求。这些考虑要求具体的制度安排 ，因此，才诞生了如今独立和负责任的中央银行体系。

The chapter then gives an introduction to cryptocurrencies and discusses the economic limitations inherent in the decentralised creation of trust which they entail. For the trust to be maintained, honest network participants need to control the vast majority of computing power, each and every user needs to verify the history of transactions and the supply of the cryptocurrency needs to be predetermined by its protocol. Trust can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralised consensus through which transactions are recorded. Not only does this call into question the finality of individual payments, it also means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value. Moreover, even if trust can be maintained, cryptocurrency technology comes with poor efficiency and vast energy use. Cryptocurrencies cannot scale with transaction demand, are prone to congestion and greatly fluctuate in value. Overall, the decentralised technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money.

本章随后将对进行介绍加密货币，并讨论了在建立分散的信任体系时所固有存在的经济限制。为了维持信任，诚实的网络参与者需要控制绝大多数计算能力，每个用户都需要验证交易的历史，并且加密货币的总供应量需要通过其网络协议预先确定。由于记录交易的分散化共识在初始阶段呈现出脆弱性，信任随时有可能会消失。这不仅会影响个人支付的最终结果，还意味着加密货币可能会停止运作，导致价值的完全丧失。而且，即使信任可以维持，加密电子货币技术的效率也很低，能源使用量还很大。加密货币不能随着交易需求的增加而随意扩大网络规模，因为容易出现网络交易拥堵，并且代币的价值波动很大。总的来说，加密货币的分散技术无论多么复杂，都不能替代法定货币背后的坚实制度依托。

That said, the underlying technology could have promise in other applications, such as the simplification of administrative processes in the settlement of financial transactions. Still, this remains to be tested. As cryptocurrencies raise a host of issues, the chapter concludes with a discussion of policy responses, including regulation of private uses of the technology, the measures needed to prevent abuses of cryptocurrencies and the delicate questions raised by the issuance of digital currency by central banks.

也就是说，加密货币的基础技术可能在其他应用程序中有所应用，例如简化金融交易结算中的行政流程。不过，这仍有待测试。由于加密货币引发了许多问题，本章最后讨论了相关的政策响应情况，包括对私人使用技术的监管，防止滥用加密货币所用到的措施以及中央银行发布数字加密货币所引发的微妙问题。

Putting the rise of cryptocurrencies into perspective
拉远视角看加密货币的崛起

A good way to examine whether a new technology can be a truly useful addition to the existing monetary landscape is to step back and review the fundamental roles of money in an economy and what history teaches us about failed attempts to create new private moneys. Then one can ask whether money based on this new technology can improve upon the current monetary landscape in any way.[2]

研究一项新技术是否能够成为现有货币格局的真正有益补充的一个好方法，是先退后一步去回顾货币在经济中的基本作用，以及关注过去所展现给我们的，关于创造新的私人货币的失败尝试。然后我们再进行发问，基于这种新技术的货币是否能够以任何方式改善当前的货币格局。[2]

A brief history of money
货币简史

Money plays a crucial role in facilitating economic exchange. Before its advent millennia ago, goods were primarily exchanged for the promise to return the favour in the future (ie trading of IOUs).[3] However, as societies grew larger and economic activity expanded, it became harder to keep a record of ever more complex IOUs, and default and settlement risks became concerns. Money and the institutions issuing it came into existence to address this growing complexity and the associated difficulty in maintaining trust. 

货币在促进经济流通交换方面起着至关重要的作用。在数千年前货币还未出现之时，货物主要通过一定的未来回报利益凭证（即交易欠条）来进行交易。[3] 然而，随着社会规模和经济活动的扩大，记录大范围错综复杂的欠条记录变得十分困难，同时也增加了对违约和结算风险的担忧。货币和发行它的机构应运而生，以应对日益增长的交易复杂性和解决相对困难的信任问题。

Money has three fundamental and complementary roles. It is: (i) a unit of account – a yardstick that eases comparison of prices across the things we buy, as well as the value of promises we make; (ii) a medium of exchange: a seller accepts it as a means of payment, in the expectation that somebody else will do the same; and (iii) a store of value, enabling users to transfer purchasing power over time.[4]

货币有三个基本和互补的功能。那就是：（i）记账单位：一个价值单位标准，可以简单衡量我们购买东西的价格，以及我们做出承诺的价值;（ii）交易媒介：卖方在认为其他人也会接受货币的认知下接受货币作为支付手段;（iii）价值存储：使用户能够不受时间影响的转移购买力。[4]

To fulfil these functions, money needs to have the same value in different places and to keep a stable value over time: assessing whether to sell a certain good or service is much easier if one is certain that the received currency has a guaranteed value in terms of both current and future purchasing power. One way to achieve this is by pure commodity moneys with intrinsic value, such as salt or grain. But commodity money by itself does not effectively support exchange: it may not always be available, is costly to produce and cumbersome in exchange, and may be perishable.[5] 

为了实现这些功能，货币需要在不同的使用场景里具有相同的价值并且随着时间的推移保持价值的稳定：如果使用者确定（或者在共识上确信）所收到的货币具有保证价值，以用于保证当前和未来的购买力，则评估是否出售某种商品或服务要容易得多。实现这一目标的一种方法是使用具有内在价值的纯商品货币，例如盐或谷物。但商品货币本身并不能有效地支持交换：它们可能并不总是可以随时使用，生产成本高，交换繁琐，并且可能会腐烂（不能持续保值）。[5] 

The expansion of economic activity required more convenient moneys that could respond to increasing demand, be efficiently used in trade and have a stable value. However, maintaining trust in the institutional arrangements through which money is supplied has been the biggest challenge. Around the world, in different settings and at different times, money started to rely on issuance by centralised authorities. From ancient times, the stamp of a sovereign certified a coin’s value in transactions. Later, bills of exchange intermediated by banks developed as a way for merchants to limit the costs and risks of travelling with large quantities of coinage.[6]

经济活动的扩大需要更方便易用的货币，这些货币可以应对不断增长的交易需求，有效地用于贸易并具有稳定的价值。然而，保持对货币供应的制度安排的信任成为了最大的挑战。在世界各地，在不同的环境和时期，货币开始依赖于中央政府的发行。从远古时代起，君主的印章为硬币在流通中的价值进行了权利背书。后来，由银行作为中介的汇票交易被商人们越来越多地使用，作为一种不再需要持有大量货币现金来进行交易的手段，减少了进行长途贸易的成本和风险。[6]

However, historical experience also made clear an underlying trade-off, for currencies that are supplied flexibly can also be debased easily.[7] Sustained episodes of stable money are historically much more of an exception than the norm. In fact, trust has failed so frequently that history is a graveyard of currencies. Museums around the world devote entire sections to this graveyard – for example, room 68 of the British Museum displays stones, shells, tobacco, countless coins and pieces of paper, along with many other objects that lost their acceptability as exchange and found their way to this room. Some fell victim to the expansion of trade and economic activity, as they were rendered inconvenient with a larger scale of use. Some were discarded when the political order that supported them weakened or fell. And many others fell victim to the erosion of trust in the stability of their value.

然而，历史进程也清楚地表明了潜在的价值流失，因为有人为调控弹性供应的货币可以轻易的贬值。[7]稳定货币历史上的能够稳定持续的情况在实际中往往比预期中的正常情况更为反常。事实上，对货币价值的信任丧失过于频繁，以至于历史变成了一种又一种货币的坟墓。世界各地的博物馆为此准备了各种，由一整个展馆来进行展示的货币消亡史展览 - 例如，大英博物馆的68号房间展示了石头，贝壳，烟草，无数的硬币和纸张，以及其他许多曾经作为货币的物品，这些物品在过去的交易中逐渐失去了使用者对其价值的认同性，并最终成为了无用的陈列品进入了这个房间。它们中的一些受制于贸易和经济活动的扩张，因为它们在贸易规模较大时变得使用不方便。还有一些在支持使用它们的政治秩序削弱或崩溃时，被人为抛弃了。另外许多其它货币由于使用者对价值稳定性的信任受损而不再使用。

History proves that money can be fragile whether it is supplied through private means, in a competitive manner, or by a sovereign, as a monopolist supplier. Bankissued money is only as good as the assets that back it. Banks are meant to transform risks, and therefore, under certain extreme scenarios, confidence in privately issued money can vanish overnight. Government-backed arrangements, where assuring trust in the instrument is a centralised task, have not always worked well either. Far from it: a well known example of abuse is the competitive debasement of coins issued by German princes in the early 17th century, known as the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (clipping and culling times).[8] And there have been many others, up to the present-day cases of Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Avoiding abuse by the sovereign has thus been a key consideration in the design of monetary arrangements.

历史证明，无论是通过私人手段，竞争招标还是作为垄断供应商的主权国家中央机构提供价值支持，货币都可能是脆弱的。银行只能用自有资产的价值来保证其发行的货币在价值上有同等的价值保障。银行总是致力于转换风险，因此，在某些极端情况下，对私人银行发行货币的信心也可能会在一夜之间消失。而由政府背书支持的货币供应，确保国民对货币资产工具在价值上的信任，是一项由政府货币发行部门集中决定和控制的任务目标，并不总是能良好运作并控制好市场规模。货币的脆弱性在历史上来说还远远不只如此：一个众所周知的滥用货币发行的例子是德国王子在17世纪早期对所发行的硬币进行竞争性贬值，被称为Kipper- und Wipperzeit（劣币危机）.[8]还有很多其他的例子，如当代的委内瑞拉和津巴布韦的案例。因此，避免主权国家的信用滥用是货币设计中的一个重要考虑因素。

The quest for solid institutional underpinning for trust in money eventually culminated in the emergence of today’s central banks. An early step was the establishment of chartered public banks in European city-states during the period 1400–1600. These emerged to improve trading by providing a high-quality, efficient means of payment and centralising a number of clearing and settlement operations. Such banks, set up in trading hubs such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Genoa, Hamburg and Venice, were instrumental in stimulating international trade and economic activity more generally.[9] Over time, many of these chartered banks functioned in ways similar to current central banks. Formal central banks, as we know them today, also often emerged in direct response to poor experiences with decentralised money. For example, the failures of wildcat banking in the United States eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

追求坚实的信任基础的制度基础最终导致了当今的中央银行的出现。早期的例子是在1400-1600年期间在欧洲城邦建立的特许公共银行。通过提供高质量，高效率的支付手段，并集中了一些清算和结算业务，这些都成为改进交易的方式。在阿姆斯特丹，巴塞罗那，热那亚，汉堡和威尼斯等贸易中心设立的这些银行在促进国际贸易和经济活动方面发挥了重要作用。[9]随着时间的推移，这些特许银行中的许多银行的运作方式变得与目前的中央银行类似。正如我们今天所了解的，正式的中央银行也出现了，直接回应了去中心化货币的不良经验。例如，美国的“野猫银行”（在联邦政府的监管之外开设的银行）业务的失败最终导致了美联储的建立。

The current monetary and payment system
目前的货币和支付系统

The tried, trusted and resilient way to provide confidence in money in modern times is the independent central bank. This means agreed goals: clear monetary policy and financial stability objectives; operational, instrument and administrative independence; and democratic accountability, so as to ensure broad-based political support and legitimacy. Independent central banks have largely achieved the goal of safeguarding society’s economic and political interest in a stable currency.10 With this setup, money can be accurately defined as an “indispensable social convention backed by an accountable institution within the state that enjoys public trust”.[11]

独立的中央银行在当代提供了可靠且值得信赖的货币信心。这意味着明确的货币制度协商目标：清晰的货币政策和金融稳定目标；操作性，工具性和行政独立性；和民主问责制，以确保基础广泛的政治支持和合法性。独立的中央银行在很大程度上实现了维护稳定货币的社会经济和政治利益的目标。通过这种设置，货币可以被精确地定义为“在享有公共信任的国家内由负责任的机构支持的不可缺少的社会共识”。[11]

In almost all modern-day economies, money is provided through a joint public-private venture between the central bank and private banks, with the central bank at the system’s core. Electronic bank deposits are the main means of payment between ultimate users, while central bank reserves are the means of payment between banks. In this two-tiered system, trust is generated through independent and accountable central banks, which back reserves through their asset holdings and operational rules. In turn, trust in bank deposits is generated through a variety of means, including regulation, supervision and deposit insurance schemes, many ultimately emanating from the state.

几乎在所有现代经济体中，货币都是通过中央银行和私人银行之间的公私合营企业提供的，中央银行则是该系统的核心。电子银行存款是终端用户之间支付的主要手段，而中央银行的存款则是银行之间的支付手段。在这个双层体系中，信任是通过独立和负责任的中央银行产生的，这些中央银行通过资产持有和操作规则支持储备。反过来，对银行存款的信任是通过各种手段产生的，包括监管，监督和存款保险计划，其中的许多手段最终来自国家机器。

As part of fulfilling their mandate to maintain a stable unit of account and means of payment, central banks take an active role in supervising, overseeing and in some cases providing the payments infrastructure for their currency. The central bank’s role includes ensuring that the payment system operates smoothly and seeing to it that the supply of reserves responds appropriately to shifting demand, including at intraday frequency, ie ensuring an elastic money supply.[12] 

作为履行其接受的维持主权货币稳定记账单位和支付手段的授权命令的一部分，中央银行在监督和监管并在某些情况下为其货币提供支付基础设施方面发挥着积极作用。中央银行的职责包括确保支付系统平稳运行，并确保储备的供应能够适应不断变化的需求，即使是在日内的频率区间范围内，简要来说即确保弹性的货币供应。[12] 

Thanks to the active involvement of central banks, today’s diverse payment systems have achieved safety, cost-effectiveness, scalability and trust that a payment, once made, is final.

有赖于中央银行的积极参与，当今多元化的支付系统已经实现了安全性，成本效益，可扩展性以及广泛信任，最终以至于每次支付一旦开启就一定能完结。

Payment systems are safe and cost-effective, handling high volumes and accommodating rapid growth with hardly any abuse and at low costs. An important contributor to safety and cost-effectiveness is scalability. In today’s sophisticated economies, the volume of payments is huge, equal to many multiples of GDP. Despite these large volumes, expanding use of the instrument does not lead to a proportional increase in costs. This is important, since an essential feature of any successful money and payment system is how widely used it is by both buyers and sellers: the more others connect to a particular payment system, the greater one’s own incentive to use it. 

支付系统既安全又具成本效益，处理量大，适应快速增长，几乎没有任何滥用且低成本。一个安全性和成本效益的重要贡献因素是系统的可扩展性。在当今复杂的经济体中，支付量巨大，数倍于各国的国内生产总值。尽管量很大，但扩大支付工具的使用并不会导致成本的成比例增加。这一点很重要，因为任何成功的货币和支付系统的基本特征，都是买卖双方能够广泛将系统应用于各种商业场景中：其他连接到对应支付系统的人越多，使用它的个体动机就越大。

Users not only need to have trust in money itself, they also need to trust that a payment will take place promptly and smoothly. A desirable operational attribute is thus certainty of payment (“finality”) and the related ability to contest transactions that may have been incorrectly executed. Finality requires that the system be largely free of fraud and operational risks, at the level of both individual transactions and the system as a whole. Strong oversight and central bank accountability both help to support finality and hence trust.

用户不仅需要对货币本身有信任，他们还需要相信支付会迅速而平稳地进行。因此，在支付过程中理想的操作属性是支付的确定性（“最终确认性”）以及判定相关交易可能被错误执行的能力。为了实现最终性的要求，系统在很大程度上在单个交易和整个系统这两个层面上，都不存在欺诈和操作风险。强有力的监督和中央银行的问责制度既有助于支持支付的“最终确认性”，也有助于增强信任。

While most modern-day transactions occur through means ultimately supported by central banks, over time a wide range of public and private payment means has emerged. These can be best summarised by a taxonomy characterised as the “money flower” (Graph V.1).[13] 

尽管大多数现代交易是通过由中央银行系统作为最终结算支持的方式进行的，但随着时间的推移，各种各样的公共和私人支付手段出现了。这些可以通过一种被称为“货币之花”的分类图表得到最好的总结。（图V.1）[13]

The money flower: a taxonomy of money Graph V.1
货币之花：货币的分类 图V.1

The money flower distinguishes four key properties of moneys: the issuer, the form, the degree of accessibility and the payment transfer mechanism. The issuer can be a central bank, a bank or nobody, as was the case when money took the form of a commodity. Its form can be physical, eg a metal coin or paper banknote, or digital. It can be widely accessible, like commercial bank deposits, or narrowly so, like central bank reserves. A last property regards the transfer mechanism, which can be either peer-to-peer, or through a central intermediary, as for deposits. Money is typically based on one of two basic technologies: so called “tokens” or accounts. Token-based money, for example banknotes or physical coins, can be exchanged in peer-to-peer settings, but such exchange relies critically on the payee’s ability to verify the validity of the payment object – with cash, the worry is counterfeiting. By contrast, systems based on account money depend fundamentally on the ability to verify the identity of the account holder.

货币之花区分了货币的四个关键属性：发行人、形式、可获取度和支付转移机制。货币的发行人可以是中央银行，商业银行或不由任意中心发行，就像货币采取商品形式的情况一样。其形式可以是物理的，例如金属硬币或纸币，也可以是电子化的。它可以像商业银行存款那样广泛获得，或者像中央银行的准备金那样严格管理。最后一个属性则是关于转移机制，可以是用户间点对点的，也可以是经由中央中介机构中转的，比如存款。货币通常基于两种基本技术之一：所谓的“代币”或账户。基于“代币”的货币（例如钞票或实体硬币）可以点对点地交易，但这种交换严重依赖收款人验证付款对象有效性的能力 - 以现金为例，则要分辨是否是假币。相比之下，基于账户资金的系统从根本上取决于验证账户持有人身份与账户中资金量是否对等的能力。

Cryptocurrencies: the elusive promise of decentralised trust
加密货币：去中心化信任的飘渺承诺

Do cryptocurrencies deliver what they promise? Or will they end up as short-lived curiosities? In order to answer these questions, it is necessary to define them more precisely, to understand their supporting technology and to examine the associated economic limitations.

加密货币是否可以传递它们所承诺的价值？或者它们最终只是昙花一现？？为了回答这些问题，有必要更准确地定义它们，以了解支持它们的技术并检验相关的经济局限性。

A new petal in the money flower?
货币之花中的新花瓣？

Cryptocurrencies aspire to be a new form of currency and promise to maintain trust in the stability of their value through the use of technology. They consist of three elements. First, a set of rules (the “protocol”), computer code specifying how participants can transact. Second, a ledger storing the history of transactions. And third, a decentralised network of participants that update, store and read the ledger of transactions following the rules of the protocol. With these elements, advocates claim, a cryptocurrency is not subject to the potentially misguided incentives of banks and sovereigns. 

加密货币被期望成为一种新的货币形式，并通过使用技术来保证维持对其自身价值稳定性的信任。它们往往由三个基本要素组成。首先，一套代码规则（“协议”），指定参与者如何进行交易的计算机代码。其次，存储交易历史的账本数据库。第三，去中心化的参与者网络根据协议的规则更新、存储和读取交易的帐本。通过使用这些元素，加密货币的倡导者声称，加密货币不受与银行和主权国家发行货币相同的潜在诱导性影响。

In terms of the money flower taxonomy, cryptocurrencies combine three key features. First, they are digital, aspiring to be a convenient means of payment and relying on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions. Second, although created privately, they are no one’s liability, ie they cannot be redeemed, and their value derives only from the expectation that they will continue to be accepted by others. This makes them akin to a commodity money (although without any intrinsic value in use). And, last, they allow for digital peer-to-peer exchange. 

就货币之花上的分类而言，加密货币结合了三个关键特征。首先，他们是数字化的，渴望成为一种便捷的支付手段，并依靠加密技术来防止伪造和欺诈性交易。其次，虽然是私人创建的，但它们不是任何人的负债，也就是说它们不能被赎回，其价值仅源于它们会继续被他人接受的期望。这使得它们类似于商品货币（尽管没有任何内在价值）。最后，它们是以完全点对点的形式来进行交易的。

Compared with other private digital moneys such as bank deposits, the distinguishing feature of cryptocurrencies is digital peer-to-peer exchange. Digital bank accounts have been around for decades. And privately issued “virtual currencies” – eg as used in massive multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft – predate cryptocurrencies by a decade. In contrast to these, cryptocurrency transfers can in principle take place in a decentralised setting without the need for a central counterparty to execute the exchange.

与其他私人数字货币（如银行存款）相比，加密货币的显著特点是数字化的点对点交换。数字银行账户已存在运行数十年。甚至还有私下发行的“虚拟货币” - 例如在像魔兽世界这样的大型多人在线游戏中使用的游戏货币 - 这比加密货币出现早了十年。与其相反，加密货币的转移交易原则上可以在去中心化的环境中进行，而不需要中央交易对手（如银行进行记账）来执行交易。

Distributed ledger technology in cryptocurrencies
加密货币中的分布式账本技术

The technological challenge in digital peer-to-peer exchange is the so-called “double-spending problem”. Any digital form of money is easily replicable and can thus be fraudulently spent more than once. Digital information can be reproduced more easily than physical banknotes. For digital money, solving the double-spending problem requires, at a minimum, that someone keep a record of all transactions. Prior to cryptocurrencies, the only solution was to have a centralised agent do this and verify all transactions. 

数字点对点交易中的技术挑战是所谓的“双花问题”。任何数字形式的货币都很容易复制，因此可能会被用于欺诈交易从而使一笔资金被花费不止一次。数字信息比实物钞票更容易复制。对于数字货币，解决双花问题至少需要某个人（或某个交易节点）可以保存所有交易记录。在加密货币之前，唯一的解决方案是让中央代理清算人执行此操作并验证所有交易。

Cryptocurrencies overcome the double-spending problem via decentralised record-keeping through what is known as a distributed ledger. The ledger can be regarded as a file (think of a Microsoft Excel worksheet) that starts with an initial distribution of cryptocurrency and records the history of all subsequent transactions. An up-to-date copy of the entire ledger is stored by each user (this is what makes it “distributed”). With a distributed ledger, peer-to-peer exchange of digital money is feasible: each user can directly verify in their copy of the ledger whether a transfer took place and that there was no attempt to double-spend.[14]

加密货币通过分散记录的方式——即所谓的分布式账本技术（DLT）克服了双花问题。账本是一个文件（可以是Microsoft Excel工作表），以记录加密货币的初始分布状态开始，并以此为基础记录所有后续交易的历史记录。整个账本的最新副本由每个用户存储（这是使其“分布式”的原因）。通过分布式账本，数字货币可以进行点对点交换：每个用户都可以直接在账本副本中验证是否发生了转账并且没有双重支付的尝试。[14]

While all cryptocurrencies rely on a distributed ledger, they differ in terms of how the ledger is updated. One can distinguish two broad classes, with substantial differences in their operational setup (Graph V.2). 

尽管所有加密货币都依赖于分布式账本，但它们在账本数据更新方面存在差异。人们可以将之区分为两大类，它们在操作设置上有很大的差异。（图V.2）

Centralised ledger and permissioned/permissionless decentralised ledgers Graph V.2
中心化账本和有许可/无许可分布式账本 图 V.2

One class is based on “permissioned” DLT. Such cryptocurrencies are similar to conventional payment mechanisms in that, to prevent abuse, the ledger can only be updated by trusted participants in the cryptocurrency – often termed “trusted nodes”. These nodes are chosen by, and subject to oversight by, a central authority, eg the firm that developed the cryptocurrency. Thus, while cryptocurrencies based on permissioned systems differ from conventional money in terms of how transaction records are stored (decentralised versus centralised), they share with it the reliance on specific institutions as the ultimate source of trust.[15]

一类是基于“需授权许可”条件下的DLT。这种加密货币机制类似于传统的支付机制，因为为了防止滥用，账本只能由加密货币中的可信参与者更新 - 通常称为“可信节点”。这些节点由中央当局选定并受其监督，例如开发加密货币的公司。因此，虽然基于授权系统的加密货币在交易记录存储方式（分散与集中）方面与传统货币不同，但它们本质上与传统货币相同 - 对特定机构的主权信用依赖是其加密货币价值最终的信任来源。[15]

In a much more radical departure from the prevailing institution-based setup, a second class of cryptocurrencies promises to generate trust in a fully decentralised setting using “permissionless” DLT. The ledger recording transactions can only be changed by a consensus of the participants in the currency: while anybody can participate, nobody has a special key to change the ledger. 

与基于机构的中心化信任相比远远的不同的是第二类加密货币，它们声称使用的是“无需授权许可”的DLT，其可以在完全去中心化的环境中获取信任。账本记录交易只能通过货币参与者的共识来改变：任何人都可以参与，但没有人有专门的权限来单独更改账本。

The concept of permissionless cryptocurrencies was laid out for the case of Bitcoin[16] in a white paper by an anonymous programmer (or group of programmers) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who proposed a currency based on a specific type of distributed ledger, the “blockchain”. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that is updated in groups of transactions called blocks. Blocks are then chained sequentially via the use of cryptography to form the blockchain. This concept has been adapted to countless other cryptocurrencies.[17]

无许可加密货币的概念是由匿名程序员（又被认为是一个程序员小组）以假名中本聪在比特币[16]的白皮书中首先被正式提出和制定的，比特币这一名称是根据一种特定类型的账本结构“区块链”而命名。区块链是一个分布式账本结构，它在被称为区块的交易信心组中进行更新。然后通过使用密码学加密技术将区块块按先后次序连续链接以形成区块链条。这个概念已经适用于无数其他加密货币。[17]

Blockchain-based permissionless cryptocurrencies have two groups of participants: “miners” who act as bookkeepers and “users” who want to transact in the cryptocurrency. At face value, the idea underlying these cryptocurrencies is simple: instead of a bank centrally recording transactions (Graph V.3, left-hand panel), the ledger is updated by a miner and the update is subsequently stored by all users and miners (right-hand panel).[18]

基于区块链的无许可加密货币有两类参与者：充当记账员的“矿工”和想要在加密货币中进行交易的“用户”。从表面上来看，这些加密货币的基本思路很简单：与银行集中记录交易（下图V3，左侧）不同，矿工负责更新账本，更新后的账本由所有用户和矿工共同存储。

Valid transactions in a centralised ledger/bank account and in a permissionless cryptocurrency Graph V.3
在中心化账本/银行账户以及无许可加密货币中验证交易 图V.3

Underlying this setup, the key feature of these cryptocurrencies is the implementation of a set of rules (the protocol) that aim to align the incentives of all participants so as to create a reliable payment technology without a central trusted agent. The protocol determines the supply of the asset in order to counter debasement – for example, in the case of Bitcoin, it states that no more than 21 million bitcoins can exist. In addition, the protocol is designed to ensure that all participants follow the rules out of self-interest, ie that they yield a self-sustaining equilibrium. Three key aspects are the following.

在这种设置的基础上，这些加密货币的关键特征是实施一组规则（协议），旨在通过激励手段协调所有参与者的行动，以便在没有中央信任代理人的情况下创建可靠的支付技术。该协议确定资产的供应上限以抵御贬值 - 例如，在比特币的例子下，该协议规定比特币的上限是2100万。此外，协议的目的是确保所有参与者都出于自身利益而维持规则，即由参与者之间产生一种可自我保持的相互平衡状态。其中主要有以下三个关键点：

First, the rules entail a cost to updating the ledger. In most cases, this cost comes about because updating requires a “proof-of-work”. This is mathematical evidence that a certain amount of computational work has been done, in turn calling for costly equipment and electricity use. Since the proof-of-work process can be likened to digging up rare numbers via laborious computations, it is often referred to as mining.[19] In return for their efforts, miners receive fees from the users – and, if specified by the protocol, newly minted cryptocurrency.

首先，这些规则带来了更新帐本的成本。在大多数情况下，这种成本是因为获得账本更新权需要获得“工作量证明”。即通过数学证据表明已经完成了一定量的计算工作，与之对应的是昂贵的设备和电力使用。由于工作量证明（PoW）过程可以类比为通过费力的计算挖掘罕见数字，因此通常被称为采矿。[19]作为对他们的努力的回报，获得账本更新权的矿工从用户处收取费用 - 如果协议进行了特定规定的话，还会附加整个系统新铸的加密货币作为奖励。

Second, all miners and users of a cryptocurrency verify all ledger updates, which induces miners to include only valid transactions. Valid transactions need to be initiated by the owners of funds and must not be attempts to double-spend. If a ledger update includes an invalid transaction, it is rejected by the network and the miner’s rewards are voided. The verification of all new ledger updates by the network of miners and users is thus essential to incentivise miners to add only valid transactions.[20]

其次，加密货币的所有矿工和用户都会验证所有的帐本更新，这会导致矿工只涵盖有效的交易。有效的交易需要由资金所有者发起，并且不能双花。如果账本更新包含无效交易，则该更新将被网络拒绝并且矿工矿工也就失去相应的更新奖励。矿工和用户网络对所有新账本更新的验证对激励矿工只添加有效交易至关重要。[20]

Third, the protocol specifies rules to achieve a consensus on the order of updates to the ledger. This is generally done by creating incentives for individual miners to follow the computing majority of all other miners when they implement updates. Such coordination is needed, for example, to resolve cases where communication lags lead to different miners adding conflicting updates – ie updates that include different sets of transactions (Box V.A). 

第三，协议规定了系列规则，以实现对账本更新的顺序达成共识。这通常是通过创建激励措施，让个人矿工在实施更新时跟随大多数算力的其他矿工。这样的协调是有必要的，例如，可以较好的解决沟通滞后导致的不同矿工添加有冲突情况的更新 - 即包含不同交易信息集的更新。(Box V.A)

With these key ingredients, it is costly – though not impossible – for any individual to forge a cryptocurrency. To successfully double-spend, a counterfeiter would have to spend their cryptocurrency with a merchant and secretly produce a forged blockchain in which this transaction was not recorded. Upon receipt of the merchandise, the counterfeiter would then release the forged blockchain, ie reverse the payment. But this forged blockchain would only emerge as the commonly accepted chain if it were longer than the blockchain the rest of the network of miners had produced in the meantime. A successful double-spend attack thus requires a substantial share of the mining community’s computing power. Conversely, in the words of the original Bitcoin white paper, a cryptocurrency can overcome the double-spending problem in a decentralised way only if “honest nodes control a majority of [computing] power”.[21]

有了这些关键要素，对于任何独立个体来说，伪造一种加密货币是很昂贵的 - 尽管不是不可能的。要成功实现双花，伪造者将不得不将自己的加密货币在商人处消费，并秘密产生伪造的区块链，在该区块链中不记录该交易。一旦收到商品，伪造者就会发布伪造的区块链，即逆转区块链上已经付款的交易记录，让加密货币回到自己手中。但是，只有这段伪造的区块链比其他网络矿工在此期间制作的区块链更长的前提下，这种伪造的区块链才可能成为被整个系统共识普遍接受的链。因此，一次成功的双花攻击需要拥有大量的算力占比。或者，用比特币白皮书的话来说，只有“诚实的节点控制了大部分[计算]能力”，加密货币才能以去中心化的方式克服双花问题。[21]

Assessing the economic limitations of permissionless cryptocurrencies
评估无许可加密货币的经济限制

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin promise to deliver not only a convenient payment means based on digital technology, but also a novel model of trust. Yet delivering on this promise hinges on a set of assumptions: that honest miners control the vast majority of computing power, that users verify the history of all transactions and that the supply of the currency is predetermined by a protocol. Understanding these assumptions is important, for they give rise to two basic questions regarding the usefulness of cryptocurrencies. First, does this cumbersome way of trying to achieve trust come at the expense of efficiency? Second, can trust truly and always be achieved? 

像比特币这样的加密货币不仅能够提供基于数字技术的便捷支付手段，而且还能提供一种新型的信任模式。然而，实现这一承诺取决于一系列假设：诚实的矿工控制绝大多数计算能力，用户验证所有交易的历史以及货币的供应是由协议预先确定的。理解这个假设很重要，因为它们涉及关于加密货币有用性的两个基本问题。首先，这种试图实现信任的繁琐方法是否以牺牲效率为代价？其次，信任是否真正和总是得以实现？

As the first question implies, a key potential limitation in terms of efficiency is the enormous cost of generating decentralised trust. One would expect miners to compete to add new blocks to the ledger through the proof-of-work until their anticipated profits fall to zero.[22] Individual facilities operated by miners can host computing power equivalent to that of millions of personal computers. At the time of writing, the total electricity use of bitcoin mining equalled that of mid-sized economies such as Switzerland, and other cryptocurrencies also use ample electricity (Graph V.4, left-hand panel). Put in the simplest terms, the quest for decentralised trust has quickly become an environmental disaster.[23]

正如第一个问题所暗示的，一个关键的潜在限制是z在效率方面，产生分布式信任所需的巨大成本。系统中的任何一个参与者会期望矿工们通过工作量证明进行竞争，从而为账本添加新的区块，这一竞争直到矿工的预期利润降至零。[22]由矿工运营的个人设施可以拥有与数百万台个人电脑相当的计算能力。在撰写本文时，比特币采矿的总用电量与瑞士等中等经济体的用电量相当，其他加密电子货币也使用了相当多的电力。(图 V.4)简而言之，对分布式信任的追求很快就会演变成一场环境灾难。[23]

But the underlying economic problems go well beyond the energy issue. They relate to the signature property of money: to promote “network externalities” among users and thereby serve as a coordination device for economic activity. The shortcomings of cryptocurrencies in this respect lie in three areas: scalability, stability of value and trust in the finality of payments. 

但潜在的经济问题远远超出能源问题。这与货币的重要性质有关：由于促进了用户之间的“网络连接外部性”，从而让货币成为了经济活动的协调工具。加密货币在这方面的缺点在于三个方面：可扩展性、价值的稳定性和对支付的最终信任。

First, cryptocurrencies simply do not scale like sovereign moneys. At the most basic level, to live up to their promise of decentralised trust cryptocurrencies require each and every user to download and verify the history of all transactions ever made, including amount paid, payer, payee and other details. With every transaction adding a few hundred bytes, the ledger grows substantially over time. For example, at the time of writing, the Bitcoin blockchain was growing at around 50 GB per year and stood at roughly 170 GB. Thus, to keep the ledger’s size and the time needed to verify all transactions (which increases with block size) manageable, cryptocurrencies have hard limits on the throughput of transactions (Graph V.4, centre panel).

首先，加密货币没有主权货币那样的规模。在最基本的层面上，实现开发者对分布式信任加密货币的保证需要每位用户下载并验证所有交易的历史记录，包括付款金额，付款人，收款人和其他详细信息。随着每次交易增加几百字节，账本的“篇幅”会随着时间的推移大幅增长。就比如，在撰写本文时，比特币区块链每年增长约50GB，并且大致保持在170GB。因此，为了有效维持在这样的总账规模下验证所有交易（随着区块变大而增加）的所需时间是可管理的，加密货币对交易吞吐量有严格的限制（图V.4，中间图）。

A thought experiment illustrates the inadequacy of cryptocurrencies as an everyday means of payment (Graph V.4, right-hand panel). To process the number of digital retail transactions currently handled by selected national retail payment systems, even under optimistic assumptions, the size of the ledger would swell well beyond the storage capacity of a typical smartphone in a matter of days, beyond that of a typical personal computer in a matter of weeks and beyond that of servers in a matter of months. But the issue goes well beyond storage capacity, and extends to processing capacity: only supercomputers could keep up with verification of the incoming transactions. The associated communication volumes could bring the internet to a halt, as millions of users exchanged files on the order of magnitude of a terabyte.

简单试想一下，就可以揭示加密货币作为日常支付手段的不足之处（图V.4，右侧图）。为了处理当前以下国家零售支付系统处理的数字零售交易的数量，即使在乐观的前提假设下，账本的规模也将在几天内超过一般智能手机的存储容量，在几个星期之内将远超普通的个人计算机的存储容量，甚至在几个月后就超过了服务器。但这个问题远远不止存储容量的范畴，并且扩展到了处理能力的问题上：只有超级计算机才能跟上新交易的验证。相关的通信量可能会导致互联网阻塞停止，因为数百万用户以TB级的数据在交换文件。

Another aspect of the scalability issue is that updating the ledger is subject to congestion. For example, in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, in order to limit the number of transactions added to the ledger at any given point in time, new blocks can only be added at pre-specified intervals. Once the number of incoming transactions is such that newly added blocks are already at the maximum size permitted by the protocol, the system congests and many transactions go into a queue. With capacity capped, fees soar whenever transaction demand reaches the capacity limit (Graph V.5). And transactions have at times remained in a queue for several hours, interrupting the payment process. This limits cryptocurrencies’ usefulness for day-to-day transactions such as paying for a coffee or a conference fee, not to mention for wholesale payments.24 Thus, the more people use a cryptocurrency, the more cumbersome payments become. This negates an essential property of present-day money: the more people use it, the stronger the incentive to use it.[25]

可扩展性问题的另一个方面是更新账本会遇到网络堵塞问题。例如，在基于区块链的加密货币中，为限制在任何给定时间点添加到账本的交易数量，只能按照预先指定的时间间隔添加新的区块。一旦传入交易的数量达到新添加的块已达到协议允许的最大大小，系统就会拥堵，并且许多交易将进入队列。由于产能上限，每当交易需求达到容量限制时，费用就会飙升（图V.5）。而且交易有时会排队几个小时，从而中断支付流程。这限制了加密货币在日常交易中的用处，例如支付咖啡或会议费用，更不用说批发性的支付了。因此，使用加密货币的人越多，付款就越麻烦。这违背了当今货币的一个重要特征：人们使用它越多，使用它的动机越强。[25]

The second key issue with cryptocurrencies is their unstable value. This arises from the absence of a central issuer with a mandate to guarantee the currency’s stability. Well run central banks succeed in stabilising the domestic value of their sovereign currency by adjusting the supply of the means of payment in line with transaction demand. They do so at high frequency, in particular during times of market stress but also during normal times. 

加密货币的第二个关键问题是它们的价值不稳定。这是由于没有一个中心化的发行机构负责保证货币价值的稳定。运行良好的中央银行通过根据交易需求调整支付手段（货币）的供应，成功地稳定了主权国家货币的本土价值。央行进行这样操作的频率很高，尤其是在市场紧张时期，在正常时期也同样如此。

This contrasts with a cryptocurrency, where generating some confidence in its value requires that supply be predetermined by a protocol. This prevents it from being supplied elastically. Therefore, any fluctuation in demand translates into changes in valuation. This means that cryptocurrencies’ valuations are extremely volatile (Graph V.6, left-hand panel). And the inherent instability is unlikely to be fully overcome by better protocols or financial engineering, as exemplified by the experience of the Dai cryptocurrency. While engineered to be fixed to the US dollar at a rate of one to one, it reached a low of $0.72 just a few weeks after its launch in late 2017. Other cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value have also fluctuated substantially (centre panel). 

这与加密货币形成了鲜明对比，对于加密货币，对其价值产生一定的信心需要协议预先确定供应量。这阻碍了弹性供应。因此，需求的任何波动都会转化为对估值的变化。这意味着加密货币的估值非常不稳定（图V.6，左侧面板）。如Dai加密货币的经验所证明的那样，更好的协议或金融工程设计不可能完全克服固有的货币不稳定性。虽然Dai被设计为锚定美元1:1的比率，可在2017年末推出后几周内便达到0.72美元的低点。其它设计具有稳定价值的加密货币也大幅波动，这种现象普遍发生在锚定货币刚刚发行时，用户对锚定机制还未充分认知，不敢使用该货币，造成总供应量和市场需求的临时错配，从而发出这种问题。

This outcome is not coincidental. Keeping the supply of the means of payment in line with transaction demand requires a central authority, typically the central bank, which can expand or contract its balance sheet. The authority needs to be willing at times to trade against the market, even if this means taking risk onto its balance sheet and absorbing a loss. In a decentralised network of cryptocurrency users, there is no central agent with the obligation or the incentives to stabilise the value of the currency: whenever demand for the cryptocurrency decreases, so does its price. 

这个结果并不是巧合。保持支付手段的供应符合交易需求，需要一个中心化的机构，通常是中央银行，可以扩大或缩小资产负债表。当局有时需要愿意与市场（参与者）进行交易，即使这意味着将风险纳入其资产负债表并吸收损失。在一个去中心化的加密货币用户网络中，没有中央代理人承担稳定货币价值的义务或动力：每当对加密货币的需求下降时，其价格也会下降。

*（这里很明显BIS没搞懂bitUSD的机制，作为BTS资深玩家我想说BTS的去中心化抵押已经实现了去中心化的资产负债吸收损失。同时锚定稳定货币会随着共识的加深价值越来越稳定。）

Further contributing to unstable valuations is the speed at which new cryptocurrencies – all tending to be very closely substitutable with one another – come into existence. At the time of writing, several thousand existed, though proliferation makes reliable estimates of the number of outstanding cryptocurrencies impossible (Graph V.6, right-hand panel). Recalling the private banking experiences of the past, the outcome of such liberal issuance of new moneys is rarely stability. 

估值不稳定的另一负面来自于新加密货币的发行速度 - 所有这些加密货币都非常类似且相互可替代。在撰写本文时，已有数千种加密货币存在，这种扩增速度使我们难以估算（图V.6，右侧面板）。回顾过去的私人银行业务的经验，这种自由发行新货币的结果是很难带来稳定性的。

The third issue concerns the fragile foundation of the trust in cryptocurrencies. This relates to uncertainty about the finality of individual payments, as well as trust in the value of individual cryptocurrencies. 

第三个问题涉及加密货币信任的脆弱基础。这涉及个人支付的完结性的不确定性，以及对单个加密货币价值的信任。

In mainstream payment systems, once an individual payment makes its way through the national payment system and ultimately through the central bank books, it cannot be revoked. In contrast, permissionless cryptocurrencies cannot guarantee the finality of individual payments. One reason is that although users can verify that a specific transaction is included in a ledger, unbeknownst to them there can be rival versions of the ledger. This can result in transaction rollbacks, for example when two miners update the ledger almost simultaneously. Since only one of the two updates can ultimately survive, the finality of payments made in each ledger version is probabilistic.

在主流支付系统中，一旦个人支付经由国家支付系统并最终通过中央银行账本进行支付，它就不能被撤销。相比之下，无许可的加密货币不能保证个人支付的完结性。其中一个原因是，虽然用户可以验证账本中是否包含特定交易，但不知道可能存在的由其他人持有的账本中的竞争版本是否包含这条特定交易。这可能导致交易回滚，例如两名矿工几乎同时更新账本时。由于两种更新只有一种可以最终生存，因此在哪个帐本版本中支付得以完结是概率性的。

The lack of payment finality is exacerbated by the fact that cryptocurrencies can be manipulated by miners controlling substantial computing power, a real possibility given the concentration of mining for many cryptocurrencies (Graph V.7, left-hand panel). One cannot tell if a strategic attack is under way because an attacker would reveal the (forged) ledger only once they were sure of success. This implies that finality will always remain uncertain. For cryptocurrencies, each update of the ledger comes with an additional proof-of-work that an attacker would have to reproduce. Yet while the probability that a payment is final increases with the number of subsequent ledger updates, it never reaches 100%.[26]

由于加密货币可以被控制大量计算能力的矿工操纵，许多加密货币的采矿活动高度集中，所以加剧了付款完结性的可信度（图V.7，左图）。人们不能分辨是否正在进行为了非法获利而进行的网络攻击，因为攻击者只有在确定成功后才会显示（伪造的）账本。这意味着交易完结性将永远不确定。对于加密货币，账本的每次更新均附带一份攻击者必须复制的额外工作量证明。即使支付完结的可能性随着后续账本更新的数量而增加，但也无法达到100％。[26]

*（但是中央结算系统也不能完全保证100%不出错吧）

Not only is the trust in individual payments uncertain, but the underpinning of trust in each cryptocurrency is also fragile. This is due to “forking”. This is a process whereby a subset of cryptocurrency holders coordinate on using a new version of the ledger and protocol, while others stick to the original one. In this way, a cryptocurrency can split into two subnetworks of users. While there are many recent examples, an episode on 11 March 2013 is noteworthy because – counter to the idea of achieving trust by decentralised means – it was undone by centralised coordination of the miners. On that day, an erroneous software update led to incompatibilities between one part of the Bitcoin network mining on the legacy protocol and another part mining using an updated one. For several hours, two separate blockchains grew; once news of this fork spread, the price of bitcoin tumbled by almost a third (Graph V.7, right-hand panel). The fork was ultimately rolled back by a coordinated effort whereby miners temporarily departed from protocol and ignored the longest chain. But many transactions were voided hours after users had believed them to be final. This episode shows just how easily cryptocurrencies can split, leading to significant valuation losses.

不仅个人支付的信任不确定，每种加密货币的信任基础也很脆弱。这是由于“分叉”。这是一个加密货币持有者中的一部分人决定协调升级使用新版本的账本和协议的过程，而另一些持有者则坚持原来的账本和协议。这样一来，一个加密货币在区块链的信息记录上不得不分成了两个用户子网。虽然最近有许多例子，但2013年3月11日的一件事尤为值得注意，由矿工的中心化协调而取消了事件的影响，这次事件引起了通过去中心化的手段实现信任的想法相违背的思考。在那一天，错误的软件更新导致使用传统协议的矿工在比特币网络挖矿产生的区块与使用更新的协议的另一部分矿工挖出的区块之间不兼容。几个小时后，两个独立的区块链逐渐壮大；当这个分叉的消息传播开来，比特币的价格几乎下跌了三分之一（图V.7，右侧面板）。最终通过矿工之间的商议协调和一致共识使分叉得以回滚，矿工们暂时脱离协议，忽略了最长的链条。但是许多交易在用户认为他们完结的几个小时后就消失了。这一事件显示了加密货币可以轻易分裂，并导致重大的估值损失。

An even more worrying aspect underlying such episodes is that forking may only be symptomatic of a fundamental shortcoming: the fragility of the decentralised consensus involved in updating the ledger and, with it, of the underlying trust in the cryptocurrency. Theoretical analysis (Box V.A) suggests that coordination on how the ledger is updated could break down at any time, resulting in a complete loss of value.

这种情形背后的一个更令人担忧的方面是，分叉可能仅仅只是加密货币基本缺陷的一个普通表现：更新账本所涉及的去中心化共识，和与之相关的加密货币的基础信任的脆弱性。理论分析表明(Box V.A)，关于如何更新账本的共识可能会随时崩溃，导致价值的完全丧失。
