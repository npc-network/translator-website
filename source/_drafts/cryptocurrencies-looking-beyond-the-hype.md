Less than 10 years after their inception, cryptocurrencies[1] have emerged from obscurity to attract intense interest on the part of businesses and consumers, as well as central banks and other authorities. They garner attention because they promise to replace trust in long-standing institutions, such as commercial and central banks, with trust in a new, fully decentralised system founded on the blockchain and related distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

从诞生到如今这不到10年的时间里，加密货币[1]从一片模糊中脱颖而出，吸引了来自部分企业，消费者，甚至于中央银行以及其他政府当局的强烈兴趣。加密货币作为一种技术，希望用一种基于新的，完全分布式的由区块链以及分布式账本技术（DLT）建立的信用体系，来代替原本由商业和中央银行等常驻金融机构所代表的信用体系，这一打破传统的尝试引起了各行各业的注意。

This chapter evaluates whether cryptocurrencies could play any role as money: looking beyond the hype, what specific economic problems, if any, can current cryptocurrencies solve? The chapter first reviews the historical context. Many episodes of monetary instability and failed currencies illustrate that the institutional arrangements through which money is supplied matter a great deal. This review shows that the essence of good money has always been trust in the stability of its value. And for money to live up to its signature property – to act as a coordination device facilitating transactions – it needs to efficiently scale with the economy and be provided elastically to address fluctuating demand. These considerations call for specific institutional arrangements – hence the emergence of today’s independent and accountable central banks.

本章将评估加密货币是否可以扮演传统经济中的金钱角色：除了炒作之外，目前的加密货币能解决哪些具体的经济问题（如果有的话）？本章首先将回顾历史背景。过去发生的许多造成货币不稳定和信用货币危机的事件表明，货币供应的制度安排非常重要。回顾这些事件，优质货币的本质是对其价值稳定性形成一贯的信任。另外，为了实现货币背后的价值背书 ，作为促进交易的社会流通媒介，货币需要在政策上有效地与经济环境进行协调并提供弹性来应对波动的需求。这些考虑要求具体的制度安排 ，因此，才诞生了如今独立和负责任的中央银行体系。

The chapter then gives an introduction to cryptocurrencies and discusses the economic limitations inherent in the decentralised creation of trust which they entail. For the trust to be maintained, honest network participants need to control the vast majority of computing power, each and every user needs to verify the history of transactions and the supply of the cryptocurrency needs to be predetermined by its protocol. Trust can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralised consensus through which transactions are recorded. Not only does this call into question the finality of individual payments, it also means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value. Moreover, even if trust can be maintained, cryptocurrency technology comes with poor efficiency and vast energy use. Cryptocurrencies cannot scale with transaction demand, are prone to congestion and greatly fluctuate in value. Overall, the decentralised technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money.

本章随后将对进行介绍加密货币，并讨论了在建立分散的信任体系时所固有存在的经济限制。为了维持信任，诚实的网络参与者需要控制绝大多数计算能力，每个用户都需要验证交易的历史，并且加密货币的总供应量需要通过其网络协议预先确定。由于记录交易的分散化共识在初始阶段呈现出脆弱性，信任随时有可能会消失。这不仅会影响个人支付的最终结果，还意味着加密货币可能会停止运作，导致价值的完全丧失。而且，即使信任可以维持，加密电子货币技术的效率也很低，能源使用量还很大。加密货币不能随着交易需求的增加而随意扩大网络规模，因为容易出现网络交易拥堵，并且代币的价值波动很大。总的来说，加密货币的分散技术无论多么复杂，都不能替代法定货币背后的坚实制度依托。

That said, the underlying technology could have promise in other applications, such as the simplification of administrative processes in the settlement of financial transactions. Still, this remains to be tested. As cryptocurrencies raise a host of issues, the chapter concludes with a discussion of policy responses, including regulation of private uses of the technology, the measures needed to prevent abuses of cryptocurrencies and the delicate questions raised by the issuance of digital currency by central banks.

也就是说，加密货币的基础技术可能在其他应用程序中有所应用，例如简化金融交易结算中的行政流程。不过，这仍有待测试。由于加密货币引发了许多问题，本章最后讨论了相关的政策响应情况，包括对私人使用技术的监管，防止滥用加密货币所用到的措施以及中央银行发布数字加密货币所引发的微妙问题。

Putting the rise of cryptocurrencies into perspective
拉远视角看加密货币的崛起

A good way to examine whether a new technology can be a truly useful addition to the existing monetary landscape is to step back and review the fundamental roles of money in an economy and what history teaches us about failed attempts to create new private moneys. Then one can ask whether money based on this new technology can improve upon the current monetary landscape in any way.[2]

研究一项新技术是否能够成为现有货币格局的真正有益补充的一个好方法，是先退后一步去回顾货币在经济中的基本作用，以及关注过去所展现给我们的，关于创造新的私人货币的失败尝试。然后我们再进行发问，基于这种新技术的货币是否能够以任何方式改善当前的货币格局。[2]

A brief history of money
货币的历史

Money plays a crucial role in facilitating economic exchange. Before its advent millennia ago, goods were primarily exchanged for the promise to return the favour in the future (ie trading of IOUs).3 However, as societies grew larger and economic activity expanded, it became harder to keep a record of ever more complex IOUs, and default and settlement risks became concerns. Money and the institutions issuing it came into existence to address this growing complexity and the associated difficulty in maintaining trust.
