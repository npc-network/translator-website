Less than 10 years after their inception, cryptocurrencies[1] have emerged from obscurity to attract intense interest on the part of businesses and consumers, as well as central banks and other authorities. They garner attention because they promise to replace trust in long-standing institutions, such as commercial and central banks, with trust in a new, fully decentralised system founded on the blockchain and related distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

从诞生到如今这不到10年的时间里，加密货币[1]从一片混沌中脱颖而出，吸引了来自部分企业，消费者，甚至于中央银行以及其他政府当局的强烈兴趣。加密货币作为一种技术，希望用一种基于新的，完全分布式的由区块链以及分布式账本技术（DLT）建立的信用体系，来代替原本由商业和中央银行等常驻金融机构所代表的信用体系，这一打破传统的尝试引起了各行各业的注意。

This chapter evaluates whether cryptocurrencies could play any role as money: looking beyond the hype, what specific economic problems, if any, can current cryptocurrencies solve? The chapter first reviews the historical context. Many episodes of monetary instability and failed currencies illustrate that the institutional arrangements through which money is supplied matter a great deal. This review shows that the essence of good money has always been trust in the stability of its value. And for money to live up to its signature property – to act as a coordination device facilitating transactions – it needs to efficiently scale with the economy and be provided elastically to address fluctuating demand. These considerations call for specific institutional arrangements – hence the emergence of today’s independent and accountable central banks.

本章将评估加密货币是否可以扮演传统经济中的金钱角色：除了炒作之外，目前的加密货币能解决哪些具体的经济问题（如果有的话）？本章首先将回顾历史背景。过去发生的许多造成货币不稳定和信用货币危机的事件表明，货币供应的制度安排非常重要。回顾这些事件，优质货币的本质是对其价值稳定性形成一贯的信任。另外，为了实现货币背后的价值背书 ，作为促进交易的社会流通媒介，货币需要在政策上有效地与经济环境进行协调并提供弹性来应对波动的需求。这些考虑要求具体的制度安排 ，因此，才诞生了如今独立和负责任的中央银行体系。

The chapter then gives an introduction to cryptocurrencies and discusses the economic limitations inherent in the decentralised creation of trust which they entail. For the trust to be maintained, honest network participants need to control the vast majority of computing power, each and every user needs to verify the history of transactions and the supply of the cryptocurrency needs to be predetermined by its protocol. Trust can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralised consensus through which transactions are recorded. Not only does this call into question the finality of individual payments, it also means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value. Moreover, even if trust can be maintained, cryptocurrency technology comes with poor efficiency and vast energy use. Cryptocurrencies cannot scale with transaction demand, are prone to congestion and greatly fluctuate in value. Overall, the decentralised technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money.

本章随后将对进行介绍加密货币，并讨论了在建立分散的信任体系时所固有存在的经济限制。为了维持信任，诚实的网络参与者需要控制绝大多数计算能力，每个用户都需要验证交易的历史，并且加密货币的总供应量需要通过其网络协议预先确定。由于记录交易的分散化共识在初始阶段呈现出脆弱性，信任随时有可能会消失。这不仅会影响个人支付的最终结果，还意味着加密货币可能会停止运作，导致价值的完全丧失。而且，即使信任可以维持，加密电子货币技术的效率也很低，能源使用量还很大。加密货币不能随着交易需求的增加而随意扩大网络规模，因为容易出现网络交易拥堵，并且代币的价值波动很大。总的来说，加密货币的分散技术无论多么复杂，都不能替代法定货币背后的坚实制度依托。

That said, the underlying technology could have promise in other applications, such as the simplification of administrative processes in the settlement of financial transactions. Still, this remains to be tested. As cryptocurrencies raise a host of issues, the chapter concludes with a discussion of policy responses, including regulation of private uses of the technology, the measures needed to prevent abuses of cryptocurrencies and the delicate questions raised by the issuance of digital currency by central banks.

也就是说，加密货币的基础技术可能在其他应用程序中有所应用，例如简化金融交易结算中的行政流程。不过，这仍有待测试。由于加密货币引发了许多问题，本章最后讨论了相关的政策响应情况，包括对私人使用技术的监管，防止滥用加密货币所用到的措施以及中央银行发布数字加密货币所引发的微妙问题。

Putting the rise of cryptocurrencies into perspective
拉远视角看加密货币的崛起

A good way to examine whether a new technology can be a truly useful addition to the existing monetary landscape is to step back and review the fundamental roles of money in an economy and what history teaches us about failed attempts to create new private moneys. Then one can ask whether money based on this new technology can improve upon the current monetary landscape in any way.[2]

研究一项新技术是否能够成为现有货币格局的真正有益补充的一个好方法，是先退后一步去回顾货币在经济中的基本作用，以及关注过去所展现给我们的，关于创造新的私人货币的失败尝试。然后我们再进行发问，基于这种新技术的货币是否能够以任何方式改善当前的货币格局。[2]

A brief history of money
货币简史

Money plays a crucial role in facilitating economic exchange. Before its advent millennia ago, goods were primarily exchanged for the promise to return the favour in the future (ie trading of IOUs).[3] However, as societies grew larger and economic activity expanded, it became harder to keep a record of ever more complex IOUs, and default and settlement risks became concerns. Money and the institutions issuing it came into existence to address this growing complexity and the associated difficulty in maintaining trust. 

货币在促进经济流通交换方面起着至关重要的作用。在数千年前货币还未出现之时，货物主要通过一定的未来回报利益凭证（即交易欠条）来进行交易。[3] 然而，随着社会规模和经济活动的扩大，记录大范围错综复杂的欠条记录变得十分困难，同时也增加了对违约和结算风险的担忧。货币和发行它的机构应运而生，以应对日益增长的交易复杂性和解决相对困难的信任问题。

Money has three fundamental and complementary roles. It is: (i) a unit of account – a yardstick that eases comparison of prices across the things we buy, as well as the value of promises we make; (ii) a medium of exchange: a seller accepts it as a means of payment, in the expectation that somebody else will do the same; and (iii) a store of value, enabling users to transfer purchasing power over time.[4]

货币有三个基本和互补的功能。那就是：（i）记账单位：一个价值单位标准，可以简单衡量我们购买东西的价格，以及我们做出承诺的价值;（ii）交易媒介：卖方在认为其他人也会接受货币的认知下接受货币作为支付手段;（iii）价值存储：使用户能够不受时间影响的转移购买力。[4]

To fulfil these functions, money needs to have the same value in different places and to keep a stable value over time: assessing whether to sell a certain good or service is much easier if one is certain that the received currency has a guaranteed value in terms of both current and future purchasing power. One way to achieve this is by pure commodity moneys with intrinsic value, such as salt or grain. But commodity money by itself does not effectively support exchange: it may not always be available, is costly to produce and cumbersome in exchange, and may be perishable.[5] 

为了实现这些功能，货币需要在不同的使用场景里具有相同的价值并且随着时间的推移保持价值的稳定：如果使用者确定（或者在共识上确信）所收到的货币具有保证价值，以用于保证当前和未来的购买力，则评估是否出售某种商品或服务要容易得多。实现这一目标的一种方法是使用具有内在价值的纯商品货币，例如盐或谷物。但商品货币本身并不能有效地支持交换：它们可能并不总是可以随时使用，生产成本高，交换繁琐，并且可能会腐烂（不能持续保值）。[5] 

The expansion of economic activity required more convenient moneys that could respond to increasing demand, be efficiently used in trade and have a stable value. However, maintaining trust in the institutional arrangements through which money is supplied has been the biggest challenge. Around the world, in different settings and at different times, money started to rely on issuance by centralised authorities. From ancient times, the stamp of a sovereign certified a coin’s value in transactions. Later, bills of exchange intermediated by banks developed as a way for merchants to limit the costs and risks of travelling with large quantities of coinage.[6]

经济活动的扩大需要更方便易用的货币，这些货币可以应对不断增长的交易需求，有效地用于贸易并具有稳定的价值。然而，保持对货币供应的制度安排的信任成为了最大的挑战。在世界各地，在不同的环境和时期，货币开始依赖于中央政府的发行。从远古时代起，君主的印章为硬币在流通中的价值进行了权利背书。后来，由银行作为中介的汇票交易被商人们越来越多地使用，作为一种不再需要持有大量货币现金来进行交易的手段，减少了进行长途贸易的成本和风险。[6]

However, historical experience also made clear an underlying trade-off, for currencies that are supplied flexibly can also be debased easily.[7] Sustained episodes of stable money are historically much more of an exception than the norm. In fact, trust has failed so frequently that history is a graveyard of currencies. Museums around the world devote entire sections to this graveyard – for example, room 68 of the British Museum displays stones, shells, tobacco, countless coins and pieces of paper, along with many other objects that lost their acceptability as exchange and found their way to this room. Some fell victim to the expansion of trade and economic activity, as they were rendered inconvenient with a larger scale of use. Some were discarded when the political order that supported them weakened or fell. And many others fell victim to the erosion of trust in the stability of their value.

然而，历史进程也清楚地表明了潜在的价值流失，因为有人为调控弹性供应的货币可以轻易的贬值。[7]稳定货币历史上的能够稳定持续的情况在实际中往往比预期中的正常情况更为反常。事实上，对货币价值的信任丧失过于频繁，以至于历史变成了一种又一种货币的坟墓。世界各地的博物馆为此准备了各种，由一整个展馆来进行展示的货币消亡史展览 - 例如，大英博物馆的68号房间展示了石头，贝壳，烟草，无数的硬币和纸张，以及其他许多曾经作为货币的物品，这些物品在过去的交易中逐渐失去了使用者对其价值的认同性，并最终成为了无用的陈列品进入了这个房间。它们中的一些受制于贸易和经济活动的扩张，因为它们在贸易规模较大时变得使用不方便。还有一些在支持使用它们的政治秩序削弱或崩溃时，被人为抛弃了。另外许多其它货币由于使用者对价值稳定性的信任受损而不再使用。

History proves that money can be fragile whether it is supplied through private means, in a competitive manner, or by a sovereign, as a monopolist supplier. Bankissued money is only as good as the assets that back it. Banks are meant to transform risks, and therefore, under certain extreme scenarios, confidence in privately issued money can vanish overnight. Government-backed arrangements, where assuring trust in the instrument is a centralised task, have not always worked well either. Far from it: a well known example of abuse is the competitive debasement of coins issued by German princes in the early 17th century, known as the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (clipping and culling times).[8] And there have been many others, up to the present-day cases of Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Avoiding abuse by the sovereign has thus been a key consideration in the design of monetary arrangements.

历史证明，无论是通过私人手段，竞争招标还是作为垄断供应商的主权国家中央机构提供价值支持，货币都可能是脆弱的。银行只能用自有资产的价值来保证其发行的货币在价值上有同等的价值保障。银行总是致力于转换风险，因此，在某些极端情况下，对私人银行发行货币的信心也可能会在一夜之间消失。而由政府背书支持的货币供应，确保国民对货币资产工具在价值上的信任，是一项由政府货币发行部门集中决定和控制的任务目标，并不总是能良好运作并控制好市场规模。货币的脆弱性在历史上来说还远远不只如此：一个众所周知的滥用货币发行的例子是德国王子在17世纪早期对所发行的硬币进行竞争性贬值，被称为Kipper- und Wipperzeit（劣币危机）.[8]还有很多其他的例子，如当代的委内瑞拉和津巴布韦的案例。因此，避免主权国家的信用滥用是货币设计中的一个重要考虑因素。

The quest for solid institutional underpinning for trust in money eventually culminated in the emergence of today’s central banks. An early step was the establishment of chartered public banks in European city-states during the period 1400–1600. These emerged to improve trading by providing a high-quality, efficient means of payment and centralising a number of clearing and settlement operations. Such banks, set up in trading hubs such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Genoa, Hamburg and Venice, were instrumental in stimulating international trade and economic activity more generally.[9] Over time, many of these chartered banks functioned in ways similar to current central banks. Formal central banks, as we know them today, also often emerged in direct response to poor experiences with decentralised money. For example, the failures of wildcat banking in the United States eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

追求坚实的信任基础的制度基础最终导致了当今的中央银行的出现。早期的例子是在1400-1600年期间在欧洲城邦建立的特许公共银行。通过提供高质量，高效率的支付手段，并集中了一些清算和结算业务，这些都成为改进交易的方式。在阿姆斯特丹，巴塞罗那，热那亚，汉堡和威尼斯等贸易中心设立的这些银行在促进国际贸易和经济活动方面发挥了重要作用。[9]随着时间的推移，这些特许银行中的许多银行的运作方式变得与目前的中央银行类似。正如我们今天所了解的，正式的中央银行也出现了，直接回应了去中心化货币的不良经验。例如，美国的“野猫银行”（在联邦政府的监管之外开设的银行）业务的失败最终导致了美联储的建立。

The current monetary and payment system
目前的货币和支付系统

The tried, trusted and resilient way to provide confidence in money in modern times is the independent central bank. This means agreed goals: clear monetary policy and financial stability objectives; operational, instrument and administrative independence; and democratic accountability, so as to ensure broad-based political support and legitimacy. Independent central banks have largely achieved the goal of safeguarding society’s economic and political interest in a stable currency.10 With this setup, money can be accurately defined as an “indispensable social convention backed by an accountable institution within the state that enjoys public trust”.[11]

独立的中央银行在当代提供了可靠且值得信赖的货币信心。这意味着明确的货币制度协商目标：清晰的货币政策和金融稳定目标；操作性，工具性和行政独立性；和民主问责制，以确保基础广泛的政治支持和合法性。独立的中央银行在很大程度上实现了维护稳定货币的社会经济和政治利益的目标。通过这种设置，货币可以被精确地定义为“在享有公共信任的国家内由负责任的机构支持的不可缺少的社会共识”。[11]

In almost all modern-day economies, money is provided through a joint public-private venture between the central bank and private banks, with the central bank at the system’s core. Electronic bank deposits are the main means of payment between ultimate users, while central bank reserves are the means of payment between banks. In this two-tiered system, trust is generated through independent and accountable central banks, which back reserves through their asset holdings and operational rules. In turn, trust in bank deposits is generated through a variety of means, including regulation, supervision and deposit insurance schemes, many ultimately emanating from the state.

几乎在所有现代经济体中，货币都是通过中央银行和私人银行之间的公私合营企业提供的，中央银行则是该系统的核心。电子银行存款是终端用户之间支付的主要手段，而中央银行的存款则是银行之间的支付手段。在这个双层体系中，信任是通过独立和负责任的中央银行产生的，这些中央银行通过资产持有和操作规则支持储备。反过来，对银行存款的信任是通过各种手段产生的，包括监管，监督和存款保险计划，其中的许多手段最终来自国家机器。

As part of fulfilling their mandate to maintain a stable unit of account and means of payment, central banks take an active role in supervising, overseeing and in some cases providing the payments infrastructure for their currency. The central bank’s role includes ensuring that the payment system operates smoothly and seeing to it that the supply of reserves responds appropriately to shifting demand, including at intraday frequency, ie ensuring an elastic money supply.[12] 

作为履行其接受的维持主权货币稳定记账单位和支付手段的授权命令的一部分，中央银行在监督和监管并在某些情况下为其货币提供支付基础设施方面发挥着积极作用。中央银行的职责包括确保支付系统平稳运行，并确保储备的供应能够适应不断变化的需求，即使是在日内的频率区间范围内，简要来说即确保弹性的货币供应。[12] 

Thanks to the active involvement of central banks, today’s diverse payment systems have achieved safety, cost-effectiveness, scalability and trust that a payment, once made, is final.

有赖于中央银行的积极参与，当今多元化的支付系统已经实现了安全性，成本效益，可扩展性以及广泛信任，最终以至于每次支付一旦开启就一定能完结。

Payment systems are safe and cost-effective, handling high volumes and accommodating rapid growth with hardly any abuse and at low costs. An important contributor to safety and cost-effectiveness is scalability. In today’s sophisticated economies, the volume of payments is huge, equal to many multiples of GDP. Despite these large volumes, expanding use of the instrument does not lead to a proportional increase in costs. This is important, since an essential feature of any successful money and payment system is how widely used it is by both buyers and sellers: the more others connect to a particular payment system, the greater one’s own incentive to use it. 

支付系统既安全又具成本效益，处理量大，适应快速增长，几乎没有任何滥用且低成本。一个安全性和成本效益的重要贡献因素是系统的可扩展性。在当今复杂的经济体中，支付量巨大，数倍于各国的国内生产总值。尽管量很大，但扩大支付工具的使用并不会导致成本的成比例增加。这一点很重要，因为任何成功的货币和支付系统的基本特征，都是买卖双方能够广泛将系统应用于各种商业场景中：其他连接到对应支付系统的人越多，使用它的个体动机就越大。

Users not only need to have trust in money itself, they also need to trust that a payment will take place promptly and smoothly. A desirable operational attribute is thus certainty of payment (“finality”) and the related ability to contest transactions that may have been incorrectly executed. Finality requires that the system be largely free of fraud and operational risks, at the level of both individual transactions and the system as a whole. Strong oversight and central bank accountability both help to support finality and hence trust.

用户不仅需要对货币本身有信任，他们还需要相信支付会迅速而平稳地进行。因此，在支付过程中理想的操作属性是支付的确定性（“最终确认性”）以及判定相关交易可能被错误执行的能力。为了实现最终性的要求，系统在很大程度上在单个交易和整个系统这两个层面上，都不存在欺诈和操作风险。强有力的监督和中央银行的问责制度既有助于支持支付的“最终确认性”，也有助于增强信任。

While most modern-day transactions occur through means ultimately supported by central banks, over time a wide range of public and private payment means has emerged. These can be best summarised by a taxonomy characterised as the “money flower” (Graph V.1).[13] 

尽管大多数现代交易是通过由中央银行系统作为最终结算支持的方式进行的，但随着时间的推移，各种各样的公共和私人支付手段出现了。这些可以通过一种被称为“货币之花”的分类图表得到最好的总结。（图V.1）[13]

The money flower: a taxonomy of money Graph V.1
货币之花：货币的分类 图V.1

The money flower distinguishes four key properties of moneys: the issuer, the form, the degree of accessibility and the payment transfer mechanism. The issuer can be a central bank, a bank or nobody, as was the case when money took the form of a commodity. Its form can be physical, eg a metal coin or paper banknote, or digital. It can be widely accessible, like commercial bank deposits, or narrowly so, like central bank reserves. A last property regards the transfer mechanism, which can be either peer-to-peer, or through a central intermediary, as for deposits. Money is typically based on one of two basic technologies: so called “tokens” or accounts. Token-based money, for example banknotes or physical coins, can be exchanged in peer-to-peer settings, but such exchange relies critically on the payee’s ability to verify the validity of the payment object – with cash, the worry is counterfeiting. By contrast, systems based on account money depend fundamentally on the ability to verify the identity of the account holder.

货币之花区分了货币的四个关键属性：发行者、形式、可得性程度和支付转移机制。

发行人可以是中央银行，银行或无人发行，就像货币采取商品形式的情况一样。其形式可以是物理的，例如金属硬币或纸币，也可以是电子化的。

它可以像商业银行存款那样广泛获得，或者像中央银行的准备金那样狭隘。

最后一个属性则是关于转移机制，可以是P2P的，也可以是经由中央中介机构，比如存款。货币通常基于两种基本技术之一：所谓的“代币”或账户。

基于“代币”的货币（例如钞票或实体硬币）可以P2P地交易，但这种交换严重依赖收款人验证付款对象有效性的能力 - 以现金为例，即担心是假币。

相比之下，基于账户资金的系统从根本上取决于验证账户持有人身份的能力。
