Not as rich as you think…
没有你想象中那么富有...

People assume that the people who worked on Bitcoin in the early years are fabulously wealthy.
人们认为早年从事比特币工作的人非常富有。

That’s a bad assumption, for lots of reasons:

It was easy to lose coins. They weren’t worth much, so people didn’t bother to take the time to keep them secure and back them up.

那是一个糟糕的假设，出于种种原因：

当时很容易丢币。 它们的价值不高，所以人们没有花时间保证它们的安全行并支持它们。

Many of the early developers didn’t have extra money to buy coins; they were still in school, or were pouring all of their money into a startup. Venture capitalists were NOT throwing money at Bitcoin startups back in 2010 and 2011.

许多早期的开发者没有多余的钱来买比特币；他们还在上学，或者把所有钱都投入到初创公司。风险投资家们也并没有在2010和2011年间给比特币初创公司投资。

“HODL” wasn’t a thing– instead, bootstrapping the community by purchasing things (like 50BTC alpaca socks or 10,000BTC pizzas) or giving away Bitcoin was encouraged.

“HODL”是不存在的事 —— 而是通过购买东西（比如50 BTC的羊驼袜或10000 BTC的比萨）或赠送比特币来鼓励社区。

Even if an early developer had the free cash and foresight to purchase a bunch of coins, they might be level-headed and follow tried and true investment advice to:

1) Make a long-term plan and stick to it, ignoring short-term market drama
2) Diversify; mix high-risk and low-risk investments, and re-balance if any one investment dominates your portfolio.

即使早期的开发者有自由现金和远见去购买很多比特币，他们可能也是头脑清醒的并且遵循经过尝试和真实的投资建议：

1) 制定长期计划并坚持下去，而忽视短期的市场浮动
2) 多样化; 混合高风险和低风险投资，并在任何一项投资主导你的投资组合时重新做平衡

Imagine a rational, disciplined person who had $100,000 in investments before they heard about Bitcoin. On January 1, 2011 they decided to take a risk and spend five thousand dollars to buy 10,000 BTC. Their long-term plan: evaluate their holdings once a year, and rebalance at the beginning of the year if their BTC holdings were more than 10% of their total investments.

设想一个理性，自律的人在听说比特币之前有100,000美元的投资。 2011年1月1日，他们决定承担风险并花费五千美元购买10,000 BTC。他们的长期计划是：每年评估以次持股，如果他们的BTC持股超过其总投资的10％，则在年初重新做平衡。

I created a spreadsheet showing what happens. They would do extremely well, ending up with over $5million– a 1,000x return on their initial investment! But they would sell almost all of their BTC along the way, ending up holding fewer than 40 BTC.

我创建了一个电子表格来显示发生了什么。 他们会做得非常好，结果有超过500万美元 - 他们初始投资1,000倍的回报！ 但是他们会在途中出售掉几乎所有的BTC，最终持有不到40 BTC。

Which is nothing to sneeze at; 40 BTC is worth a few hundred thousand dollars, and 5 million dollars in safe, liquid investments is enough to fund a very comfortable retirement.

不能忽视的是，40 BTC价值几十万美元，以及500万美元有保障，流动投资足以提供一个非常舒适的退休生活。
